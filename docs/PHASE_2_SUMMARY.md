# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 of the Amazon PPC Simulator has been successfully started! This phase focuses on implementing the core features of the application, beginning with campaign management.

## What Was Accomplished

### Week 3: Campaign CRUD Operations âœ… COMPLETE

#### Backend Implementation
1. **Database Schema (Prisma)**
   - Complete schema with Users, Campaigns, Keywords, AdGroups, Products, PerformanceMetrics, TutorialProgress
   - Proper relationships and indexes
   - Enum types for type safety

2. **Folder Structure**
   ```
   src/backend/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Configuration management
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/     # API request handlers
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database/        # Prisma schema and seeds
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/      # Express middleware
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/          # API routes
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Business logic
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/           # Helper functions
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.ts          # Express app setup
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.ts       # Server entry point
   ```

3. **Campaign Service**
   - `createCampaign()` - Create new campaigns with validation
   - `getUserCampaigns()` - Get all campaigns with filtering
   - `getCampaignById()` - Get single campaign
   - `updateCampaign()` - Update campaign properties
   - `deleteCampaign()` - Soft delete (archive) campaigns
   - `getCampaignStats()` - Calculate campaign metrics (CTR, CVR, ACOS, ROAS)

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/campaigns` - Create campaign
   - `GET /api/campaigns` - List campaigns with filters
   - `GET /api/campaigns/:id` - Get single campaign
   - `PUT /api/campaigns/:id` - Update campaign
   - `DELETE /api/campaigns/:id` - Delete campaign
   - `GET /api/campaigns/:id/stats` - Get campaign statistics

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Winston logger with file and console transports
   - Error handling middleware
   - Custom error classes (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
   - Prisma client with query logging
   - Health check endpoint

6. **Testing**
   - Jest configuration
   - Unit tests for campaign service
   - 42.85% test coverage on campaign service
   - All tests passing

#### Frontend Implementation
1. **Folder Structure**
   ```
   src/frontend/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # Reusable React components
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/           # Page components
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # API service layer
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ store/           # Redux state management
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ slices/      # Redux slices
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/           # TypeScript types
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx         # Main app component
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx        # App entry point
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme.ts        # Material-UI theme
   ```

2. **State Management (Redux)**
   - Campaign slice with async thunks
   - Actions: fetchCampaigns, createCampaign, updateCampaign, deleteCampaign
   - Loading and error state management

3. **API Service**
   - Axios-based API client
   - Type-safe API calls
   - Error handling

4. **UI Components**
   - `HomePage` - Landing page with call-to-action
   - `CampaignListPage` - Display campaigns in responsive grid
   - `CampaignFormDialog` - Create new campaigns with validation
   - Material-UI theme with Amazon branding (orange/dark blue)

5. **Features**
   - View campaigns with key metrics
   - Create new campaigns
   - Form validation
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Responsive design

#### Developer Experience
1. **Docker Compose**
   - PostgreSQL 15
   - Redis 7
   - Easy one-command setup

2. **Setup Script**
   - Automated environment setup
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Generates Prisma client
   - Runs migrations
   - Seeds test data

3. **Documentation**
   - Backend README with API documentation
   - Frontend README with setup instructions
   - Updated main README with comprehensive guide
   - Code comments
