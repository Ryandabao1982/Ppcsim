# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 of the Amazon PPC Simulator has been successfully started! This phase focuses on implementing the core features of the application, beginning with campaign management.

## What Was Accomplished

### Week 3: Campaign CRUD Operations ✅ COMPLETE

#### Backend Implementation
1. **Database Schema (Prisma)**
   - Complete schema with Users, Campaigns, Keywords, AdGroups, Products, PerformanceMetrics, TutorialProgress
   - Proper relationships and indexes
   - Enum types for type safety

2. **Folder Structure**
   ```

   │   ├── config/          # Configuration management
   │   ├── controllers/     # API request handlers
   │   ├── database/        # Prisma schema and seeds
   │   ├── middleware/      # Express middleware

   │   ├── app.ts          # Express app setup
   │   └── server.ts       # Server entry point
   ```

3. **Campaign Service**
   - `createCampaign()` - Create new campaigns with validation
   - `getUserCampaigns()` - Get all campaigns with filtering
   - `getCampaignById()` - Get single campaign
   - `updateCampaign()` - Update campaign properties
