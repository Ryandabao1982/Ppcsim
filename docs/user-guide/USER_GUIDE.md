- Matches: "best wireless headphones," "wireless headphones bluetooth," "wireless headphones for running"
- **Use when:** Testing new keywords, maximizing reach

**Phrase Match**
- Keyword: `wireless headphones`
- Matches: "best wireless headphones," "wireless headphones sale"
- Does NOT match: "headphones wireless"
- **Use when:** More control over relevance

**Exact Match**
- Keyword: `wireless headphones`
- Matches: Only "wireless headphones"
- **Use when:** Targeting specific, high-converting searches

### 4.3 Adding Keywords to Your Campaign

**Step 1: Open Your Campaign**
- Click on your campaign name
- Navigate to "Keywords" tab

### 4.4 How to Choose Keywords

**Good Keywords:**
- Relevant to your product
- Have search volume (people actually search for them)
- Not too expensive (start with $0.50-2.00 bids)

**Keyword Ideas:**
- Product name + features (e.g., "bluetooth headphones noise canceling")
- Product type (e.g., "wireless earbuds")
- Use cases (e.g., "headphones for gym")
- Competitor products (e.g., "alternative to AirPods")

### 4.5 Setting Bids

**What is a Bid?**
- The maximum you'll pay when someone clicks your ad
- Higher bids = better ad placement
- Don't always need the highest bid to win

**Bidding Strategy:**
- **Start Low:** Begin with $0.50-1.00 bids
- **Test:** See which keywords get clicks
- **Increase Winners:** Raise bids on keywords that convert
- **Lower Losers:** Reduce bids on expensive keywords

### 4.6 Negative Keywords

**What Are Negative Keywords?**
- Keywords you DON'T want to match
- Prevent wasted ad spend

**Example:**
- Selling premium headphones at $200
- Add negative keyword: "cheap"
- Your ad won't show for "cheap wireless headphones"

**Adding Negative Keywords:**
1. Click "Negative Keywords" tab
2. Click "Add Negative Keyword"
3. Enter keyword (e.g., "free," "cheap," "fake")
4. Save

## 5. Understanding Performance Metrics

### 5.1 Key Metrics Explained

**Impressions**
- How many times your ad was shown
- **Good:** High impressions = visibility
- **Target:** Thousands per day (varies by product)

**Clicks**
- How many times people clicked your ad
- **Formula:** Clicks = People interested in your product

**Click-Through Rate (CTR)**
- Percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks
- **Formula:** CTR = (Clicks √∑ Impressions) √ó 100
- **Good CTR:** 0.5% to 2%+ (higher is better)

**Conversions**
- How many clicks resulted in sales
- **This is what matters most!**

**Conversion Rate (CVR)**
- Percentage of clicks that converted to sales
- **Formula:** CVR = (Conversions √∑ Clicks) √ó 100
- **Good CVR:** 10%+ (varies by product)

**Spend**
- Total money spent on ads
- **Track:** Make sure you stay within budget

**Sales**
- Revenue generated from conversions
- **Goal:** Sales should exceed spend!

**ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sale)**
- Most important metric for profitability
- **Formula:** ACOS = (Spend √∑ Sales) √ó 100
- **Example:** $20 spend, $100 sales = 20% ACOS
- **Good ACOS:** 15-30% (depends on profit margins)

**Cost Per Click (CPC)**
- Average amount paid per click
- **Formula:** CPC = Spend √∑ Clicks
- **Typical:** $0.20 to $2.00 (varies by category)

**Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**

- **Formula:** ROAS = Sales √∑ Spend
- **Example:** $100 sales, $20 spend = 5x ROAS

## 6. Optimizing Campaigns

- Track results of changes

### 6.2 Optimization Strategies

Goal: Get more impressions and clicks
```

- If not spending full budget, you might need higher bids

### 6.3 ACOS Targets

- If profit margin is 30%, break-even ACOS is 30%
- Goal: Keep ACOS below break-even
- **Aggressive:** 15-20% ACOS
- **Moderate:** 20-30% ACOS
- **Break-even:** 30-40% ACOS

### 6.4 Common Mistakes to Avoid
